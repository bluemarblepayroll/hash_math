Ruby's Hash data structure is ubiquitous and highly flexible.  This library contains common Hash patterns widely used within our code-base:

* Matrix: build a hash up then expand into hash products
* Record: define a list of keys and a base value (for each key) to use as a blueprint for hashes
* Table: key-value pair builder for constructing a two-dimensional array (rows by fields)

See examples for more information on each data structure.

## Installation

To install through Rubygems:

````bash
gem install install hash_math
````

You can also add this to your Gemfile:

````bash
bundle add hash_math
````

## Examples

### Matrix: The Hash Combination Calculator

HashMath::Matrix is a key-value builder that outputs all the different hash combinations.

Say we have this type of matrix:

````ruby
{
  a: [1,2,3],
  b: [4,5,6],
  c: [7,8,9]
}
````

We could code this as:

````ruby
matrix = HashMath::Matrix.new
matrix.add_each(:a, [1,2,3])
matrix.add_each(:b, [4,5,6])
matrix.add_each(:c, [7,8,9])
````

Note: you can also call `Matrix#add` to only add a single value instead of add_each.

and get the combinations by calling to_a:

````ruby
combinations = matrix.to_a
````

which would yield the following hashes:

````ruby
[
  { a: 1, b: 4, c: 7 },
  { a: 1, b: 4, c: 8 },
  { a: 1, b: 4, c: 9 },
  { a: 1, b: 5, c: 7 },
  { a: 1, b: 5, c: 8 },
  { a: 1, b: 5, c: 9 },
  { a: 1, b: 6, c: 7 },
  { a: 1, b: 6, c: 8 },
  { a: 1, b: 6, c: 9 },

  { a: 2, b: 4, c: 7 },
  { a: 2, b: 4, c: 8 },
  { a: 2, b: 4, c: 9 },
  { a: 2, b: 5, c: 7 },
  { a: 2, b: 5, c: 8 },
  { a: 2, b: 5, c: 9 },
  { a: 2, b: 6, c: 7 },
  { a: 2, b: 6, c: 8 },
  { a: 2, b: 6, c: 9 },

  { a: 3, b: 4, c: 7 },
  { a: 3, b: 4, c: 8 },
  { a: 3, b: 4, c: 9 },
  { a: 3, b: 5, c: 7 },
  { a: 3, b: 5, c: 8 },
  { a: 3, b: 5, c: 9 },
  { a: 3, b: 6, c: 7 },
  { a: 3, b: 6, c: 8 },
  { a: 3, b: 6, c: 9 },
]
````

Notes:

* Matrix implements Ruby's Enumerable, which means you have the ability to iterate over each hash combination like you would any other Enumerable object.
* Values can be arrays and it still works.  For example, `#add` (singular form) will honor the array data type: `matrix.add(:a, [1,2,3])` is **not** the same as: `matrix.add_each(:a, [1,2,3])` but it **is** the same as: `matrix.add(:a, [[1,2,3]])`
* Keys are type-sensitive and work just like Hash keys work.

### Record: The Hash Prototype

HashMath::Record generates a prototype hash and ensures all derived hashes conform to its shape.

Say we have a person hash, for example:

````ruby
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Matt',
  location: 'Chicago'
}
````

we could create a record modeling this:

````ruby
record = HashMath::Record.new(%i[id name location], 'UNKNOWN')
````

Then, we could shape all other hashes using it to ensure each key is populated.  If a key is not populated, the base value will be used ('UNKNOWN' in our case.)  For example:

````ruby
records = [
  record.make(id: 1, name: 'Matt', location: 'Chicago', dob: nil),
  record.make(id: 2, age: 24),
  record.make(id: 3, location: 'Los Angeles')
]
````

Note: The keys `dob` and `age` appeared in the input but will be ignored as they do not conform to the Record.  You could make this strict and raise an error by calling `#make!` instead of `#make`.

our `records` would now equate to:

````ruby
[
  { id: 1, name: 'Matt', location: 'Chicago' },
  { id: 2, name: 'UNKNOWN', location: 'UNKNOWN' },
  { id: 3, name: 'UNKNOWN', location: 'Los Angeles' },
]
````

Notes:

* keys are type-sensitive and works just like Hash keys work.

### Table: The Double Hash (Hash of Hashes)

HashMath::Table builds on top of HashMath::Record.  It constructs a table data-structure using a key-value pair builder method: `#add(row_id, field_id, value)`.  It ultimately outputs an array of Row objects where each Row object has a row_id and fields (field_id => value) hash.  The value proposition here is you can iterate over a key-value pair and construct each row any way you wish.

Building on our Record example above:

````ruby
record = HashMath::Record.new(%i[name location], 'UNKNOWN')

table = HashMath::Table.new(record)
                       .add(1, :name, 'Matt')
                       .add(1, :location, 'Chicago')
                       .add(2, :name, 'Nick')
                       .add(3, :location, 'Los Angeles')
                       .add(2, :name 'Nicholas') # notice the secondary call to "2, :name"

rows = table.to_a
````

which would set our variable `rows` to:

````ruby
[
  HashMath::Row.new(1, { name: 'Matt', location: 'Chicago' }),
  HashMath::Row.new(2, { name: 'Nicholas', location: 'UNKNOWN' }),
  HashMath::Row.new(3, { name: 'UNKNOWN', location: 'Los Angeles' })
]
````

Notes:

* `#add` will throw a KeyOutOfBoundsError if the key is not found.
* key is type-sensitive and works just like Hash keys work.

### Unpivot: Hash Key Coalescence and Row Extrapolation

Sometimes the expected interface is column-based, but the actual data store is row-based.  This causes an impedance between the input set and the persistable data set.  HashMath::Unpivot has the ability to extrapolate one hash (row) into multiple hashes (rows) while unpivoting specific keys into key-value pairs.

For example: say we have a database table persisting key-value pairs of patient attributes:

patient_id | field           | value
---------- | --------------- | ----------
2          | first_exam_date | 2020-01-03
2          | last_exam_date  | 2020-04-05
2          | consent_date    | 2020-01-02

But our input data looks like this:

````ruby
patient = {
  patient_id: 2,
  first_exam_date: '2020-01-03',
  last_exam_date: '2020-04-05',
  consent_date: '2020-01-02'
}
````

We could use a HashMath::Unpivot to go from one hash to three hashes:

````ruby
pivot_set = {
  pivots: [
    {
      keys: %i[first_exam_date last_exam_date consent_date],
      coalesce_key: :field,
      coalesce_key_value: :value
    }
  ]
}

rows = HashMath::Unpivot.new(pivot_set).expand(patient)
````

The `rows` variable should now be equivalent to:

````ruby
[
  { patient_id: 2, field: :first_exam_date, value: '2020-01-03' },
  { patient_id: 2, field: :last_exam_date,  value: '2020-04-05' },
  { patient_id: 2, field: :consent_date,    value: '2020-01-02' }
]
````

Note: `HashMath::Unpivot#add` also exists to update an already instantiated object with new pivot_sets.

### Mapper: Constant-Time Cross-Mapper

The general use-case for `HashMath::Mapper` is to store pre-materialized lookups and then use those lookups efficiently to fill in missing data for a hash.

For example: say we have incoming data representing patients, but this incoming data is value-oriented, not entity/identity-oriented, which may be what we need to ingest it properly:

````ruby
patient = { patient_id: 2, patient_status: 'active', marital_status: 'married' }
````

It is not sufficient for us to use patient_status and marital_status, what we need is the entity identifiers for those values.  What we can do is load up a HashMath::Mapper instance with these values and let it do the work for us:

````ruby
patient_statuses = [
  { id: 1, name: 'active' },
  { id: 2, name: 'inactive' },
  { id: 3, name: 'archived' }
]

marital_statuses = [
  { id: 1, code: 'single' },
  { id: 2, code: 'married' },
  { id: 3, code: 'divorced' }
]

mappings = [
  {
    lookup: {
      name: :patient_statuses,
      by: :name
    },
    set: :patient_status_id,
    value: :patient_status,
    with: :id
  },
  {
    lookup: {
      name: :marital_statuses,
      by: :code
    },
    set: :marital_status_id,
    value: :marital_status,
    with: :id
  }
]

mapper = HashMath::Mapper
  .new(mappings)
  .add_each(:patient_statuses, patient_statuses)
  .add_each(:marital_statuses, marital_statuses)

mapped_patient = mapper.map(patient)
````

The variable `mapped_patient` should now be equal to:

````ruby
{
  patient_id: 2,
  patient_status: 'active',
  marital_status: 'single',
  patient_status_id: 1,
  marital_status_id: 2
}
````
